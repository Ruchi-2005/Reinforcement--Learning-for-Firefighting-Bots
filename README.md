# Reinforcement--Learning-for-Firefighting-Bots
**INTRODUCTION**

This project is a Python simulation that replicates a real-life firefighting scenario using artificial intelligence. It showcases how a group of agents (representing firefighters) can collaborate to detect, manage, and extinguish fires on a grid-based environment. The simulation integrates Q-learning for strategic decision-making, the A* algorithm for efficient pathfinding, and a collaborative chain system that allows agents to pass water to one another.
Set on a 10x10 grid, the agents navigate the area to identify fires, collect water from designated sources, and support fellow agents by transferring water when needed. Fires can spread to neighboring tiles, increasing the challenge and emphasizing the need for effective teamwork among the agents.
