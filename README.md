# Reinforcement--Learning-for-Firefighting-Bots
# Introduction

This project simulates a grid-based firefighting scenario where AI-powered agents collaborate using Q-learning, A* pathfinding, and inter-agent communication. It demonstrates how decentralized decision-making and smart coordination can optimize firefighting in dynamic, resource-constrained environments.

# Algorithm used
1.	Independent Q-Learning (IQL)
2.	A* Pathfinding

# Packages used
1.	Numpy         >=1.19 
2.	Pygame        >=2.0.
3.	Random       >=3.7.0
4.	PIL (Pillow) >=8.0

# Objectives
Simulate a realistic firefighting scenario using AI agents.
Use reinforcement learning (Q-learning) for training autonomous agents.
Implement A* for optimal pathfinding across the grid.
Enable agent collaboration via a water-passing chain mechanism.
Demonstrate decentralized decision-making, resource sharing, and adaptive behavior in high-risk environments.

# Simulation Features
🔥 Fires can spread to nearby cells.

💧 Water sources are limited, requiring agents to refill.

🤝 Agents can pass water to teammates in need.

📍 10x10 grid environment with obstacles and fire zones.

🧠 Intelligent agents trained using reinforcement learning.
